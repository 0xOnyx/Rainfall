let's start to exec the sowftware :
./level9

is make nothing 

so let's deep dive inside the disassemble 


push    ebp
mov     ebp, esp
push    ebx
and     esp, 0FFFFFFF0h
sub     esp, 20h
cmp     [ebp+argc], 1
jg      short loc_8048610


is look that so the programm need one argument to exec 


so let's try with one argument :
./level9 a 

but make nothing too

so let's try to decompile the software to look what is make
